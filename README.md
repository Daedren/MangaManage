# MangaManage

Helps convert a folder of Tachiyomi downloads into an archive of .cbz files with metadata that is also deleted after being marked as read on Anilist

### To-do

- [ ] Better UX for updating Anilist IDs (Ask user for input, should still have a non-interactive mode)
- [ ] Generate empty database on first run
- [ ] Inject loggers rather than print to console
- [ ] Don't set `manga` in ComicInfo if it's not japanese
